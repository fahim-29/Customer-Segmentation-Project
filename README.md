# Customer Segmentation Using K-Means Clustering

This project performs customer segmentation using K-Means clustering on e-commerce transactional data to identify unique customer personas for targeted marketing.

## 🔧 Tools & Libraries
- Python, Pandas, NumPy
- Matplotlib, Seaborn
- Scikit-learn (KMeans, PCA)

## 📊 Workflow Summary
- Cleaned and preprocessed raw customer transaction data
- Engineered features like total revenue, frequency, and recency
- Applied K-Means clustering to segment customers
- Used PCA for dimensionality reduction and visualized results
- Generated actionable business insights to enhance customer strategy

## 📌 Key Insights
- Identified 5 distinct customer segments
- High-spending, loyal, and dormant segments visualized using scatter plots
- Project can support targeted marketing, upselling, and retention

## 📁 Files
- `customer_segmentation.ipynb`: Full code and analysis
- `dataset.csv`: (You may choose to omit or anonymize)
- Visuals included for clarity

## 🚀 Future Improvements
- Add dashboard using Streamlit
- Expand with demographic data
